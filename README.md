## Part II: Front-end using React

# Task #3 - Moving to React Components

For this task, we would like you to create another repository (just to keep things clean) and reuse the application created in the previous part. The design itself of the frontend doesn't need to be particularly or perfect. We are more interested in the react components working rather than the styling looking perfect.

You will need to replace the Django template system with reusable react components, also you will consume the movies data using Django Rest Framework and axios or any other library for HTTP requests in the front-end.

The React views needed are:
Movie list view (with date sorting and input filter)
Add movie ratings (rate from 0 to 5 stars and comments)
Let your imagination fly and create any other reusable component needed.
